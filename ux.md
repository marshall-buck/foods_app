Here is my App idea

A food nutrition app, that helps people make better choices when choosing foods, This is not a food tracker app.  The  main focus of the app  is to let a user quickly search food items, and compare the nutritional make up between foods to make better food choices without having to count calories.  Iâ€™m going to let the user search the db, from within the app, so no internet connection required.    Although the database used will be limited right now to the USDA SR legacy foods,

For instance I want to quickly find out the  grams of sugars between apples and oranges,  So i do a search in the app, for apples, i choose apples, I do a search in the app for oranges i choose oranges, then the app automatically goes to a visually inventive comparison, of all the nutrients included in the back end, for 100 grams of apples and oranges.  This is the minimum viable app. The default value will be 100 grams of food 1 compared to 100 grams of food 2.

**Additional Features**
	- Ability to change food weight from 100g to any weight, locking both foods together or changing weights separately .
	- Ability to change a  nutrient weight to find out how much food to eat to satisfy the inputted nutrient value.
	- Ability to save favorite foods.
	-  Ability to search by nutrients,  as in which food items contain x amount of nutrient per y amount of food.
	-  top 10 lists, of nutrient density per 100 grams of food item.
	- Ability to add custom food items.

When applying these colors, consider testing them in your app's interface to ensure they provide good readability, contrast, and overall user experience.

For a cohesive and scalable design system, defining semantic color tokens is crucial. These tokens abstract the purpose of the color usage in the interface, rather than the color itself, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in your design system. Here are the semantic color tokens you might use, with explanations for each:

1. **Primary:** Used for primary actions, highlights, and to draw attention to key elements (e.g., main buttons, active states).

2. **Secondary:** Supports the primary color for less prominent UI elements that still require visual distinction (e.g., secondary buttons, secondary navigation).

3. **Tertiary:** Used for elements that are less critical but still part of the action hierarchy (e.g., tertiary buttons, borders, accents).

4. **Background:** The base color for app backgrounds, providing a neutral canvas for content and UI elements.

5. **Surface:** Used for UI elements like cards, modals, and panels, providing a slight contrast against the primary background for depth and segmentation.

6. **OnPrimary:** Text or icons displayed on top of primary-colored elements, ensuring high contrast and legibility.

7. **OnSecondary:** Text or icons displayed on secondary elements, tailored for readability against the secondary color.

8. **OnTertiary:** Text or icons on tertiary elements, ensuring clarity and visibility.

9. **OnBackground:** The primary color used for text and icons against the background, optimized for readability.

10. **OnSurface:** Text or icons displayed on surface elements, ensuring sufficient contrast for legibility.

11. **Error:** Used to indicate errors or important warnings (e.g., validation errors, failed actions).

12. **Success:** Indicates successful operations or states (e.g., confirmation messages, completed statuses).

13. **Warning:** Used for warnings or cautionary information that isn't critical but requires attention (e.g., unsaved changes).

14. **Info:** For informational messages that provide context or additional details (e.g., help text, tooltips).

15. **Divider:** For subtle lines that divide sections of content or UI elements, helping to organize and separate information visually.

16. **Shadow:** Used for drop shadows under elements to create depth and elevate UI components above others.

17. **Highlight:** A subtle color used for hover states, selected items, or to highlight key information.

By defining these semantic color tokens in your design system, you create a flexible framework that can easily adapt to branding changes without altering the functional intent of each color within your app's UI. This approach ensures consistency, scalability, and ease of maintenance in your design process.





In a design system, using multiple shades for surfaces can add depth, hierarchy, and visual interest to your UI. Typically, 3 to 5 shades are sufficient for most design systems, allowing for nuanced layering without overwhelming the interface. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Base Surface:**
- The primary surface color used for the app's background. It sets the foundational tone for the UI.

### 2. **Secondary Surface:**
- A slightly altered shade of the base surface, used for elements like cards, modals, and menus. This differentiation helps these elements stand out from the background, creating a sense of layering.

### 3. **Tertiary Surface:**
- Used for subtle distinctions within components (e.g., within a card or modal that already uses the secondary surface color). It can highlight sections or elements like headers, footers, or dividers within larger UI components.

### 4. **Hover State Surface:**
- A variation used to indicate hover states over clickable elements. This shade is typically slightly lighter or darker than the element's default state, depending on your base surface color.

### 5. **Disabled State Surface:**
- A muted shade that indicates a non-interactive or disabled state for UI elements. It should be discernibly different but not too distant from the element's active state to maintain visual harmony.

### Considerations:
- **Contrast & Accessibility:** Ensure there is enough contrast between surface shades and between text/icons and their backgrounds to meet accessibility standards.
- **Brand Consistency:** Shades should align with your brand's color palette, contributing to a cohesive look and feel.
- **Contextual Use:** Choose where and how to use different shades purposefully, based on what each UI element represents or its importance in the interface hierarchy.

Using a defined set of surface shades helps in creating a clear visual structure, making the UI intuitive and easy to navigate for users. It's also flexible enough to accommodate most design needs without complicating the color system.

Based on our conversation regarding the food nutrition comparison app, we can structure the Object-Oriented UX (OOUX) as follows to encapsulate the core functionalities, user interactions, and information architecture of the app.

### OOUX Framework

#### Objects

1. **Food Item**
   - **Attributes:** Name, Category, Nutritional Information (calories, carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals), Serving Size, Custom Notes.
   - **Relationships:** Belongs to categories like Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, etc. Can be compared with other Food Items.
   - **CTAs:** Compare, Add to Favorites, Adjust Serving Size, View Details.

2. **Comparison**
   - **Attributes:** Selected Food Items, Nutritional Information Comparison, Adjustable Quantities for each food item.
   - **Relationships:** Consists of two or more Food Items.
   - **CTAs:** Save Comparison, Share Comparison, Adjust Quantities.

3. **User Profile**
   - **Attributes:** Name, Dietary Preferences (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free), Saved Favorites, Custom Food Items.
   - **Relationships:** Owns Saved Favorites and Custom Food Items.
   - **CTAs:** Update Preferences, View Saved Favorites, Add Custom Food Item.

4. **Custom Food Item**
   - **Attributes:** Name, Nutritional Information, Serving Size, User Notes.
   - **Relationships:** Created by User, Can be added to Comparisons and Favorites.
   - **CTAs:** Edit, Delete, Add to Comparison.

5. **Favorites**
   - **Attributes:** List of Favorite Food Items and Comparisons.
   - **Relationships:** Contains Food Items and Comparisons marked as favorite by the User.
   - **CTAs:** View, Remove from Favorites, Share.

6. **Nutrient**
   - **Attributes:** Name, Amount per Serving Size, Recommended Daily Intake.
   - **Relationships:** Associated with Food Items, Criteria for Nutrient-Based Search.
   - **CTAs:** Search Foods by Nutrient.

#### Relationships

- **Food Item to Food Item:** Many-to-many (for comparison purposes).
- **Food Item to User Profile:** Many-to-one (User can save multiple food items as favorites).
- **Custom Food Item to User Profile:** Many-to-one (User can create multiple custom food items).
- **Comparison to User Profile:** Many-to-one (User can save multiple comparisons as favorites).
- **Nutrient to Food Item:** Many-to-many (A food item can have multiple nutrients; a nutrient can be found in multiple food items).

#### CTAs (Call to Actions)

- **Search:** Allows users to search for Food Items by name or nutrients.
- **Compare:** Enables comparison of nutritional information between two or more Food Items.
- **Save to Favorites:** Users can save Food Items or Comparisons for quick access.
- **Adjust Serving Size:** Users can modify the serving size in comparisons for personalized nutritional information.
- **Add Custom Food Item:** Users can create entries for foods not found in the database.
- **Search by Nutrient:** Users can find Food Items high in a specific nutrient.

This OOUX framework provides a clear structure of the app's main entities, their attributes, how they relate to each other, and the key actions users can take. This approach helps in designing a more intuitive and structured user experience by aligning the design and development process closely with how users conceptualize and interact with the app's content.
